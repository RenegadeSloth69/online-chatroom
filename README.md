<ul>
  <li>Users are able to login-logout, register, edit profile info such as avatar, bio</li>
  <li>Able to view room participants</li>
  <li>Add room creator as the first participant, and everyone else who chats in the room as the other participants. no feature to join a room per se</li>
  <li>Filter rooms using topics, room names, room creators, and description</li>
</ul>

<p>The responsiveness is a bit messed up. I have not spent much time configuring the layout either. This is a project i started working on for developing and practicing Django. Feel free to clone and customise this and share! Expect more projects in the future!</p>
